The dashboard is interactive and allows the user to check reports with high levels of specificity.
By default, the dashboard shows an overall value.\
For example,\
We can check to see the revenue of Logic Stores in May of 2020 by clicking on the calendar element and then selecting the store in the chart(result shown below)

We can monitor the performance of specific elements like the size of a company's order and the major areas of generating revenue.\
The dashboard allows us to make informed and data-driven decisions.

This dashboard can also be imported into a website via an API call or by embedding it into an element of the page.

The reports are generated in real time and will change according to changes in the SQL database.

PowerQuery and DAX allow us to perform ETL operations on the data from the SQL server but it won't alter the information on the SQL server.
